# basic-rust-web-server
This is the first very basic web-server that I created with Rust. It was my first exercise with this programming language. 

To run the project after pull it down to your system just use the cargo build + cargo run commands. 

Requirements: 
Rust has to be installed on your system. 

Thanks for visiting, see you later! :)
